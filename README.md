Industrial Machine Failure Predictor (AI4I 2020)
This project implements a Predictive Maintenance system using a Random Forest Classifier to forecast machine failures. By applying physics-based feature engineering, the model achieves high reliability in identifying potential breakdowns before they occur.

Key achievements:
**Recall Optimisation:** Improved recall from  0.59 to **0.75**, ensuring that critical failures are caught by the model.
**Balanced Performance:** The model achieved an **F1-Score of 0.84** which provides a robust mix of reliability and precision.
**Feature Engineering:** **Power** and **Temperature Delta (dT)** were ranked as the top predictors for machine failure, which more closely follows the laws of mechanical thermodynamics.

Feature engineering:
Recall was opimised by implementing specific features not present in the dataset.
1. **Power ($Torque \times RPM$):** Captures high-stress states where the machine is subject to both high load and high velocity.
2. **Temperature Delta ($T_{proc} - T_{air}$):** Isolates the excess heat generated by the process which causes damage and wear on the machine, this in turn is an indicator for friction and lubrication failure.

Model evaluation:
The model was tuned using `RandomizedSearchCV` to optimise for **recall**, because missing a critical failure is significantly more expensive than inspecting a false alarm.
**Accuracy:** 98.2%
**Recall:** 75%
**F1-score:** 0.84
